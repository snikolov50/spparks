==================
Running Example(s) 
==================

Three example input scripts are provided which highlight the use of the app
style "potts/crystalline_orientations."  This app takes the basic Potts model 
app and adds quaternions to each site to emulate the effect of crystalline 
orientation during grain growth in polycrystals.  The natural symmetries of 
different crystal systems are used to assign disorientation angles to grain 
boundaries, see the documentation of this app for more details. A Read-Shockley 
model is used to calculate low-angle grain boundary energies.

Running the provided scripts requires SPPARKS that be built with the
STITCH library. Details of running the examples are described below. In these
examples SPPARKS was compiled into the executable *spk_mpi*.


Running example scripts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   mpirun -np 8 spk_mpi < in.potts_cubic
   python plot_stitch_cut.py potts_cubic --field=site 0 100 0 100

   mpirun -np 8 spk_mpi < in.potts_cubic_2d
   python plot_stitch_cut.py potts_cubic_2d --field=site 0 100 0 100

   mpirun -np 8 spk_mpi < in.potts_hcp_cutoff25
   python plot_stitch_cut.py potts_hcp_cutoff25 --field=site 0 100 0 100


This will produce log files and STITCH database files with labels
"potts_cubic", "potts_cubic_2d" and "potts_hcp_cutoff25," which can be compared
to similar simulations in the examples/potts folder to see how Read-Shockley
affects grain evolution. Also note that grains grow faster in the pseudo 2d
simulation "potts_cubic_2d" compared to fully 3d simulation "potts_cubic".

For reference, the image file 'cubic_potts_step_06.png' in this directory, is a 2D
slice of microstructure in the {xy}-plane at the locus {z=0}, as computed with
the script examples/crystalline_orientations/in.cubic_potts.  This image can be produced 
using the above python script 'plot_stitch_cut.py'.

The python commands will then visualize the content of
the STITCH database files. You will need to have the STITCH Python module
installed, see the manual for more details.
